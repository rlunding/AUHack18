                    <h2>Thank you for considering volunteering for AUHack</h2>
                    <p>
                    Volunteers are the oil that makes AUHack run smoothly, and our event is completely based on volunteer work. 
                    Both the organizer team and the people working during the weekend are students that volunteer. 
                    Becoming a volunteer does not necessarily require that you can be available all the time. 
                    We can use your help for a couple of hours or throughout the whole weekend. 
                    You decide when you are available, any help and any skillset is welcome! 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why Volunteer?</h3>
                    <p>
                    Becoming a volunteer for AUHack is great fun. 
                    You get to participate in a team of great people. 
                    Solving different problems and doing a variety of work. 
                    Furthermore you have the opportunity to form a network and talk to sponsors. 
                    Volunteer work also looks great on your resume!
                    </p>
                    <h3>How is the work organised?</h3>
                    <p>
                    Our volunteers do lots of different things, both before and during the event. 
                    Examples of tasks could be manning our info stands, guiding participants around, 
                    setting up events, moving furniture around, emptying trash, filling up buffets and lots of other tasks.
                    We work in a task based manner and try to get as much variety into the work as possible, 
                    and therefore you will work with multiple things over the weekend. 
                    You will be part of a great team and will get assignments as they come in. 
                    You will also be eating and hanging out with the other volunteers in our great volunteer lounge. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>How do I sign up?</h3>
                    <p>
                    You sign up by completing <a href="https://auhack.typeform.com/to/y1vddQ">this form</a>. Remember not to take any more shifts than you can handle or make work in your schedule. 
                    Even though we love to have many volunteers, it should be a fun and exciting experience.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Can I volunteer and participate at the same time?</h3>
                    <p>
                    As a participant you can not volunteer during the hackathon. However we still need lots of help setting up and taking down the events. 
                    If you want to volunteer for this you can sign up using <a href="https://auhack.typeform.com/to/B1Pq6i">this form</a>.  
                    This work will take place thursday the 12th of april and just after the events ends on sunday the 15th of april. 
                    If you help out sunday, we will of course provide dinner for you.

                                    <p>A hackathon is an event where people within the IT-world, often students, meet and collaborate
                                        with each other to develop prototypes or IT-concepts. The purpose of a hackathon
                                        is rarely to produce finished products, but rather creating ideas and “hacks”.</p>
                                    <p>A hackathon has nothing to do with evil-intended “hacking” where bank systems or other
                                        digital solutions are penetrated and exposed. Instead participants hack technology
                                        together and develop solutions manifested in prototypes.</p>
                                    <p>A hackathon gathers people from many interdisciplinary groups, and let them compete to
                                        create the best concept and prototype, typically within 48 hours.</p>

                                    <p>AUHack is for all students from around the world. Most of the participants are students
                                        from Aarhus University that studies Computer Science, IT Product Development, Digital
                                        Design, Information Studies or Engineering.</p>
                                    <p>The students that participate in these hackathons are often the ambitious ones, and the
                                        ones that are passionate about IT and their studies. They clear their schedule for
                                        3 whole days, spends an entire weekend, and refrain from sleeping for two nights
                                        in a row, to develop the best concepts and prototypes.</p>
                                    <p>In our experience, it is students from the top shelf that find the time to participate
                                        in these events. It is now third year in a row AUHack is held, and over 200 students
                                        from 10 nations participated last year.</p>
